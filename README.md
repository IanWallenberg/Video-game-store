Project 8 - Data Interaction 💻

This project is part of module Data Interaction, where we dive into the backend part of programming.
I have learned to use MongoDB, both through Atlas and Compass, and I have worked with POST, GET, and other ways of retrieving data

As for now it's a work in progress, and it was finished 31st of March (although it does miss the payment functionality)

npm install (in both server and client)
-> to get dependencies
PRESS npm run dev TO START
-> (uses concurrently to fetch both urls)
